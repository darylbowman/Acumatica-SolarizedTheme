# Acumatica-SolarizedTheme
> ### An Acumatica theme using Ethan Schoonover's [Solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) palette

It is ideal for environments such as manufacturing where a traditional light theme may be too bright and a dark theme would too dark or draw undue attention to dusty monitors.

The theme is technically a blend of both light and dark theme colors.

## To get this functionality:
1. Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/beardedmogul/Acumatica-SolarizedTheme/releases/download/20r2/SolarizedBlendTheme.zip)
1. Upload to the 'Customization Projects' screen in Acumatica
1. Publish the customizations
1. Navigate to 'Site Preferences' (SM.20.05.05)
1. Change the 'Interface Theme' to 'Solarized'

Note:
It's not perfect. There are a few limitations outside of my control, but I welcome feedback and suggestions.
